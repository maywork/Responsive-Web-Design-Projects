        Here's a time line of Cleopatra's life:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>69 BCE</strong>
          "- Born in Alexandria, Egypt"
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>51 BCE</strong>
          "- Cleopatra Takes the Throne alongside his 12 year old brother"
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>49 BCE</strong>
          "- Cleopatra is expelled, the advisers of her younger brother stage a revolution against Cleopatra and exile her from Alexandria so that her brother-husband can rule alone."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>44 BCE</strong>
          "- Deaths of Caesar and Ptolemy XIV, after Caesar is instated as dictator in Rome, his comrades plot together and successfully assassinate him. Not even a month later, Cleopatra's co-regent Ptolemy XIV is poisoned, on her orders."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>42 BCE</strong>
          "- Meeting of Cleopatra and Marc Antony, Marc Antony takes effective rule of Rome and calls for Cleopatra, who sided with his opponent previously. She submits to his authority and retains her throne, and we can assume that this may have at least planted the seeds for the beginning of their sexual relationship."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong></strong>
          "- Birth of Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene, Cleopatra gives birth to Antony's twins, a boy and a girl."

          "- Cleopatra Bargains with Octavian Post-Actium, after a terrible loss at Actium, Cleopatra realizes she can no longer rely on Antony to keep her kingdom stable. She speaks with Octavian, who offers her protection in exchange for the death of Antony."
        </li>
        <li><strong>31 BCE</strong>
        "- Deaths of Antony and Cleopatra,to gain favor with Octavian, Cleopatra stages a plot so that Antony attempts suicide. He is ultimately successful, however, several months later Cleopatra also commits suicide in the face of a Roman invasion."
        </li>
      </ul>
